Class Scheduler

This project displays a form to enter personal information and class schedules. After the information is entered, it's checked over with client-side validation and if it passes validation, a confirmation page is displayed. The confirmation page includes the resulting JSON data that would be sent when actually submitting the form.

The project was given to me as an exercise for a job application.
